## Revolutionary Core Infrastructure

<Warning>
**Pioneering Independence:** Paxeer Network is building the **first EVM L2 to transition into EVM-compatibility without EVM-dependency**. We maintain full compatibility while creating a fully self-sustainable ecosystem.
</Warning>

Paxeer Network is built on our own native infrastructure, designed for independence and performance:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="ArgusVM (AVM)"
    icon="microchip"
    href="/argus-vm"
  >
    Register-based virtual machine with 256-bit native arithmetic. EVM-compatible but not EVM-dependent—the foundation of our self-sustainable ecosystem.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="OPAX-28 Token Standard"
    icon="coins"
    href="/opax-28"
  >
    Native fungible token standard optimized for ArgusVM and OpenLang. Built-in safety, better performance, and Rust-inspired syntax.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="EVM-Compatible but Not EVM-Dependent" icon="link">
    We maintain full compatibility with existing Ethereum tooling and contracts while building our own execution environment:
    
    - ✅ Execute existing Solidity contracts (via translation layer)
    - ✅ Support all Ethereum wallets and tools
    - ✅ Maintain bridge compatibility
    - ✅ **No dependency on EVM infrastructure**
    - ✅ Full control over VM evolution
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Self-Sustainable Ecosystem" icon="globe">
    Build a complete ecosystem without external dependencies:
    
    - **ArgusVM**: Native register-based execution environment
    - **OpenLang**: Rust-inspired smart contract language
    - **OPAX-28**: Native token standard
    - **Custom gas model**: Optimized for our architecture
    - **Independent evolution**: No reliance on Ethereum upgrades
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Benefits" icon="gauge">
    Our native infrastructure provides significant advantages:
    
    - **10,000+ TPS** per core (vs ~15 TPS for EVM)
    - **<1ms latency** for simple contract calls
    - **Register-based architecture** eliminates stack overhead
    - **Optimized gas costs** for common operations
